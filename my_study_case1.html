    <h1>Understanding Named Entity Recognition (NER)</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. What is NER?</h2>
        <p>Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to identify and classify key pieces of information (entities) within text. The goal of NER is to locate specific words or phrases in a text and label them as belonging to certain predefined categories.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Key Concepts in NER</h2>
        <p>Named Entities are specific pieces of information in the text, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Person Names: e.g., <em>"Albert Einstein"</em></li>
            <li>Organizations: e.g., <em>"Microsoft," "United Nations"</em></li>
            <li>Locations: e.g., <em>"Paris," "Mount Everest"</em></li>
            <li>Dates and Times: e.g., <em>"January 1, 2024," "10:00 AM"</em></li>
            <li>Other Domain-Specific Entities: NER can be customized to detect entities specific to a field, like diseases and medications in healthcare, or product names in e-commerce.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Classification in NER</h2>
        <p>NER not only detects entities but also categorizes them. For example, the word <em>"Tesla"</em> might be classified as an "Organization" or "Product," depending on the context.</p>
    </div class="section">
        <h2>4. Data
        </h2>
        <h3>4.1 Data Source</Data></h3>
        <p>
        EMR data refers to the digital version of a patient's paper medical chart. It contains comprehensive health-related information about a patient, which is collected and maintained 
        by healthcare providers over time. EMR data plays a crucial role in healthcare delivery, analytics, and research.
        </p>

        <p>I am using an EMR data from kaggle website, the data is like below:</p>
        <img src="assets/img/emr.png" alt="EMR Data Sample" width="500" height="300">
        <p>The original dataset has 3384 rows and 5 columns. </p>

        <h3>4.2 Data Cleaning</Data></h3>
        <p>Two columns description and transcripton were processed with data cleaning, special characters and 
            numbers were removed, all letters were lowered cased. 
        </p>

        <h2>5. NLP</h2>
        <P>Spacy is a popular library for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
           It provides tools for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, 
           and named entity recognition (NER).
           The spaCy pipeline Tokenizes the text into words. Applies the NER model to classify phrases 
           or words into entity categories.The pre-trained model en_ner_bc5cdr_md is trained on biomedical 
           text, so it specializes in identifying entities like diseases or chemicals.
            <br>
            <br>
           In this study, the top 3 name entities of diseases and chemicals for each transcripton are extracted. 
            <br>
           The final output is like below:
           <br>
           <br>
           <img src="assets/img/top_entity.png" alt="EMR Data Sample" width="500" height="300">
        </P>
        <h2>6. Future Work</h2>
        <p>
            If we know the diagnosis for some records, we could predict the unknown diagnosis based on the name 
            entities like diseases and chemicals. 
        </p>
